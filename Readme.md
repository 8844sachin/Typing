This Python-based Typing Speed Test is a console application that challenges users to type a randomly selected sentence as quickly and accurately as possible. It displays a motivational welcome screen, provides a sentence to type, and starts timing once the user begins typing. Upon completion, it calculates and displays key metrics such as time taken, words per minute (WPM), typing accuracy percentage, and the number of errors made. The program uses Python's built-in random, time, and os modules for functionality and formatting. It's designed for users looking to practice and improve their typing speed in an engaging and user-friendly terminal interface.
